## Code Editing

The Mono Editor provides a powerful code editing experience based on the Monaco Editor.

### Syntax Highlighting

Mono Editor provides syntax highlighting for the Mono language, making your code more readable and easier to understand. The syntax highlighting is customized specifically for Mono language constructs, including:

- Components and frames
- Props and state
- Event handlers
- Rendering blocks
- Control flow statements

### Code Completion

As you type, the editor suggests completions for variables, functions, and keywords. The completion system includes:

- Language keywords
- Component names
- Variable and function names
- Code snippets (see [Snippet Manager](#snippet-manager))

### Code Navigation

Navigate your code efficiently with these features:

- **Go to Definition**: Jump to the definition of a symbol
- **Find All References**: See all places where a symbol is used
- **Outline View**: See the structure of your file
- **Breadcrumbs**: Navigate through the hierarchy of your code

### Code Formatting

Format your code with a consistent style using the Format Document command (Shift+Alt+F). The formatter follows the Mono language style guidelines and ensures consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.

## Terminal

The integrated terminal allows you to run commands without leaving the editor.

### Multiple Terminals

You can create multiple terminal instances, each with its own shell and working directory. This allows you to run different commands in parallel, such as:

- Running your application
- Executing tests
- Managing version control
- Installing dependencies

### Terminal Features

- **Command History**: Access previously executed commands
- **Copy and Paste**: Copy text from the terminal and paste commands
- **Search**: Search through terminal output
- **Clear**: Clear the terminal output
- **Restart**: Restart a terminal if it encounters an error

## Debugging

Mono Editor includes a powerful debugger for Mono applications.

### Breakpoints

Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific points. You can:

- Add and remove breakpoints by clicking in the gutter
- Enable and disable breakpoints without removing them
- Set conditional breakpoints that only trigger when a condition is met
- Set logpoints that log a message without pausing execution

### Debug Controls

Control the execution of your program with these debug commands:

- **Start/Continue**: Start or resume execution
- **Pause**: Pause execution
- **Step Over**: Execute the current line and move to the next line
- **Step Into**: Step into a function call
- **Step Out**: Execute until the current function returns
- **Restart**: Restart the debugging session
- **Stop**: Stop debugging

### Debug Views

Inspect your program's state with these debug views:

- **Variables**: View and modify variable values
- **Call Stack**: See the current execution path
- **Breakpoints**: Manage all breakpoints
- **Console**: View output and evaluate expressions

## Snippet Manager

The Snippet Manager allows you to create, edit, and use code snippets to speed up your development.

### Snippet Features

- **Create Snippets**: Create custom code snippets for frequently used code patterns
- **Edit Snippets**: Modify existing snippets to suit your needs
- **Delete Snippets**: Remove snippets you no longer need
- **Categorize Snippets**: Organize snippets by category for easy access
- **Import/Export Snippets**: Share snippets with others or back them up

### Using Snippets

Snippets can be inserted into your code in several ways:

1. **Code Completion**: Type the snippet prefix and select it from the completion list
2. **Snippet Manager**: Open the Snippet Manager and click on a snippet to insert it
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use keyboard shortcuts to quickly insert snippets

### Snippet Format

Each snippet has the following properties:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the snippet
- **Prefix**: The text you type to trigger the snippet
- **Category**: The category the snippet belongs to
- **Description**: A brief description of what the snippet does
- **Body**: The code template with placeholders for customization

### Snippet Placeholders

Snippets can include placeholders that you can tab through after insertion:

- `${1:default}`: A placeholder with a default value
- `${2}`: A simple placeholder
- `$0`: The final cursor position

### Importing and Exporting Snippets

You can share snippets with others or back them up:

- **Export**: Export your snippets to a JSON file
- **Import**: Import snippets from a JSON file

## Performance Monitoring

The Performance Monitoring system helps you track and optimize the performance of your Mono applications.

### Performance Metrics

The system collects various performance metrics:

- **Load Times**: How long it takes for different parts of the application to load
- **Component Initialization**: How long it takes to initialize components
- **Resource Usage**: How much time and resources are used by different parts of the application
- **Slow Resources**: Identification of resources that take a long time to load

### Performance Dashboard

The Performance Dashboard in the Settings panel provides a visual representation of performance metrics:

- **Load Times**: A table of load events and their timing
- **Component Initialization**: A table of component initialization times
- **Resource Usage**: A table of slow resources and their loading times
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Suggestions for improving performance

### Optimization Suggestions

The system provides suggestions for improving performance based on the collected metrics:

- **Code Splitting**: Suggestions for splitting large files
- **Lazy Loading**: Suggestions for lazy loading components
- **Resource Optimization**: Suggestions for optimizing slow resources
- **Component Optimization**: Suggestions for optimizing slow components

## Error Handling

The Error Handling system provides robust error detection, reporting, and recovery.

### Error Detection

The system detects various types of errors:

- **Uncaught Exceptions**: JavaScript exceptions that are not caught by try-catch blocks
- **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Promise rejections that are not handled
